# MathPD

The Department of Mathematics at Western University is excited to introduce MathPD :tada:, a series of professional development workshops for graduate students that aim to help you acquire soft skills essential to a career in mathematics.

We will cover everything from typesetting your papers and talks to marketing yourself and your research to preparing for the job market. Everyone is welcome! 

MathPD will kick off on November 6 and run roughly once every three weeks. Each session is 90 minutes long and will take place in MC 107. There will be pizzas!
- LaTeX @ 4:30 pm on November 6, 2024. 
- Collaboration @ 4:30 pm on November 27, 2024.

:calendar: More events and workshops are planned for the Winter 2025 semester. Stay tuned!

### LaTeX (November 6 @ 4:30 pm in MC 107)

LaTeX is a document preparation system widely used in mathematics. Every mathematician is expected to know how to use LaTeX. It is used not only for typesetting papers and theses but also for graphics, presentations and CVs. At its core, LaTeX is a mark-up language (similar to markdown or HTML) where plain text special commands produce well-formatted math and other document constructs. Computer programs (such as `pdflatex` or `lualatex`) compile LaTeX source files to create beautiful PDFs. 

The LaTeX workshop is facilitated by Kelvin Chan. Everyone is welcome, even if you already know some LaTeX. The workshop will be tailored to the needs of the audience.

We will gain some hands-on experience with LaTeX. At the end of the workshop, you will
- know the basics of LaTeX to typeset a wide range of mathematical entities,
- have created a basic paper or presentation,
- have successfully produced PDFs from your skeleton document,
- know how to manage multi-file projects 
- know some LaTeX technical terms so you know how to ask for help and
- have references for more LaTeX-related goodies.

:computer: Participants should bring a laptop with a local LaTeX installation (see https://tug.org/texlive/) or an Overleaf.com account.
- Overleaf is free and suitable for learning LaTeX and typesetting short documents. However, collaboration features require a paid subscription. You can get paid Overleaf features for free with a local installation.
- Windows users should follow the [easy install instructions](https://tug.org/texlive/windows.html#install). The full package includes an editor called [TeXworks](https://tug.org/texworks/).
- Mac users should install [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/). It includes an editor called [TeXShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/).
- If you can run TeXworks on Windows or TexShop on Mac, your installation is ready. Don't worry if you run into problems. We will help you get a local installation up and running. 

### Collaboration (November 27 @ 4:30 pm in MC 107)

Details are to be announced.
